# My favorite series: Attack On Titan
**Attack On Titan is the best ong**
One of the best anime series *subjectively* out there
the three things i like about attack on titan
1. Plot
2. Characters
3. Animation (idk about season 3 onwards i'd say its okay)
When Eren said ***it's time to attack the titans***, it was truly a peak moment!
